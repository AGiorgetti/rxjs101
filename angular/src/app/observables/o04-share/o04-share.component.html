<h2>Stream with an initial value (not shared)</h2>
<p>
  <strong>notShared$</strong> is <strong>NOT SHARED</strong>, this means that for every async pipe, the functionality to calculate the value will be executed again
</p>
<ul>
  <li>First = {{notShared$|async}}</li>
  <li>Second = {{notShared$|async}}</li>
</ul>
<p>Both expressions are displayed correctly</p>

<h2>Stream with an initial value (shared)</h2>
<p>
  <strong>shared$</strong> is <strong>SHARED</strong>, this means that for all async pipes, the functionality will be executed only once
</p>
<ul>
  <li>First = {{shared$|async}}</li>
  <li>Second = {{shared$|async}}</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the first expression is displayed correctly</p>
<p>
  The share() operator will publish the first value on the first subscription. The first async pipe will subscribe and get
  the value. The second async pipe however will subscribe after that value has already been emitted and therefore will miss
  it.
</p>

<h2>Stream with an initial value (shareReplay)</h2>
<p>
  <strong>sharedReplay$</strong> is <strong>SHARED</strong>, this means that for all async pipes, the functionality will be executed only once
</p>
<ul>
  <li>First = {{sharedReplay$|async}}</li>
  <li>Second = {{sharedReplay$|async}}</li>
</ul>
<p>Both expressions are displayed correctly and the functionality is only executed once</p>
<p>
  the shareReplay(1) operator will do a publishReplay(1).refcount() behind the scenes which keeps track of the last element in
  the stream, and will emit it again when the second subscription is made.
